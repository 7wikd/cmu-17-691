What makes decision making hard is the uncertainty and stochasticity. If you’re calculating the value of something you need to be able to understand how uncertainty and reducing uncertainty around that decision in a computational way can allow you to make a clear determination on how much value you’re providing by reducing that uncertainty. You need to have basic modeling tools to build those models.
